# Assignment-8-Seaborn-2
# Planets Data Visualizations

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates data visualization using Python's Seaborn library. It leverages the built-in *planets* dataset from Seaborn to create two insightful visualizations:
- A histogram with a KDE overlay (with a log-scaled x-axis) that shows the distribution of planet masses.
- A heatmap of the correlation matrix for numerical features in the planets dataset.

These visualizations help to reveal patterns in the data and offer a glimpse into the relationships between the various planetary features.

## Files Included
- **tt3.py**: The main Python script that generates the visualizations.
- **README.md**: This file, which provides an overview, instructions, and details about the project.

## Requirements
- **Python 3.x**
- **Seaborn** (for plotting and accessing the built-in datasets)
- **Matplotlib** (for additional plotting control)
- **Pandas** (for data manipulation)

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install seaborn matplotlib pandas
